https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08184

It also reproduces the simulation results reported in this paper.

It has two configuraitons:
useMNIST = True which uses the MNIST database 

useMNIST = False which uses the synthetic data and has two scenarios

For scenario A set : syntheticSenarioAorB = True

For scenario A set : syntheticSenarioAorB = False
